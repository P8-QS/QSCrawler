## What is VitalSlayer?

**VitalSlayer** is a mobile dungeon crawling game that transforms your personal health data into engaging gameplay. By syncing with Health Connect, the game generates a new dungeon each day based on your:

- 👣 **Steps**
- 💤 **Sleep quality**
- ❤️ **Heart rate and HRV**
- 🔋 **Active calories**
- 📱 **Screen time**
- 🫁 **VO₂ Max**

Your daily habits influence your in-game stats, environment, and enemies — encouraging a fun, gamified loop of real-world self-improvement.

## 🧩 How It Works

Each day, your dungeon is shaped by your real-world habits. For example:

| Metric              | In-Game Effect                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steps**           | Steps affect map size, more steps means larger map                                                                         |
| **Sleep**           | Poor sleep causes hallucinations, making the player see enemies that aren't real                                           |
| **Heart Rate/HRV**  | Affects the variety of enemy levels that spawn — higher HRV means greater variety                                          |
| **Active Calories** | Determines whether doors open freely or require clearing enemies first                                                     |
| **Screen Time**     | Affects map visibility — poor screen time adds fog (only current/visited rooms visible), good screen time reveals full map |
| **VO₂ Max**         | High VO₂ Max grants immunity to slow effects; low VO₂ Max leaves player vulnerable                                         |

These mechanics not only reward healthy habits and encourage daily reflection, but also help players better understand their health data — such as the impact of heart rate variability on overall well-being.

## 📈 Health + Game Feedback

At the start of each dungeon run, you’ll receive:

- A **summary screen** highlighting which health metrics will influence the game
- Short tips or insights encouraging habit improvement
  An in-game NPC offers general health tips, explains metrics like HRV or VO₂ Max in simple terms, and gives advice on how to improve them through daily habits.

---

## 🎓 Academic Context

**Daily Dungeon Challenge** was developed as part of a research project at **Aalborg University**,  
investigating how gamified health data can promote reflection, understanding, and behavior change.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Do I need to manually input my health data?**

A: The dungeon reflects it, but you can still play. Some days might be tougher — just like in life!

**Q: Can I compare my dungeon with friends?**  
A: Multiplayer or social dungeon sharing is on the roadmap!
